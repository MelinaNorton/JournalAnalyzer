It appears that you intended to provide a list of journal data, but the actual journal content is missing from your message. To perform the requested analysis and recommend the most suitable journal based on the desired attributes, I need the following information for each journal you want considered:

- Journal name
- Field/Scope
- Impact factor
- Types of cell lines commonly featured (e.g., MCF10A)
- Typical modeling approaches (e.g., mechanistic, statistical, etc.)

**Desired attributes summary:**
- **Field:** Neuroscience
- **Impact factor:** Greater than 5
- **Cell line:** MCF10A
- **Modeling type:** Mechanistic

**Next steps:**  
Please provide the journal data or a table/list with the above details. Once you do, I will analyze and recommend the most appropriate journal, with a clear explanation of my reasoning.
