## 1. **Oncogene (2007): "A hidden oncogenic positive feedback loop caused by crosstalk between Wnt and ERK Pathways"**

- **Field:** Cancer biology, signaling pathways (Wnt/ERK); not neuroscience.
- **Impact Factor:** Oncogene is a high-impact journal (2024 IF ≈ 8.0).
- **Cell Line:** Experimental validation in **HEK-293** cells (human embryonic kidney), **not MCF10A** (a non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line).
- **Mode-type:** **Mechanistic**—uses ODE-based mathematical modeling to uncover feedback loops and bistability.
- **Relevance to Neuroscience:** The focus is on cancer signaling, not neural systems.

## 2. **PLoS Biology (2003): "The Roles of APC and Axin Derived from Experimental and Theoretical Analysis of the Wnt Pathway"**

- **Field:** Cell signaling, Wnt pathway; not neuroscience.
- **Impact Factor:** PLoS Biology is a high-impact journal (2024 IF ≈ 7.0).
- **Cell Line:** Uses **Xenopus egg extracts** (amphibian), **not MCF10A**.
- **Mode-type:** **Mechanistic**—detailed kinetic modeling of pathway components.
- **Relevance to Neuroscience:** Focuses on Wnt signaling, which is relevant in development and some neural contexts, but the study is not neuroscience-focused.
